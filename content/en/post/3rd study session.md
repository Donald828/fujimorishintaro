Thanks to the friends who participated, the third installment was very exciting and ended successfully.
Opportunity to talk and discuss with people from different workplaces
I feel that it is very important (because it tends to be insufficient if you just work normally).
I'm thinking of starting the 4th bullet soon. Please contact me if you are interested.
